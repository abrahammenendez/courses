**What is this?**

For the past six years I've taken a lot of courses in my free time. Sadly, I never thought about compiling them into a list. Since 2019, I've been trying to write down (and rate) every new course I take.

So here it is! A rated list of all the courses I've taken since 2019.

If you want to read a small review, there is usually one in the repo's README :)
